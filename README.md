# Next.js Project Setup

## Requirements

Before setting up and running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: v14.0.0 or later
- **npm**: v6.0.0 or later

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/didyouwin07/fileshare-ui.git
    ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd fileshare-ui
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

4. **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The development server should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your Node.js and npm versions meet the requirements above.
- If you encounter any issues, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm i` again.
